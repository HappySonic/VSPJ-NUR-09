# 09 - Exercise - Windows Forms 2

## Create the Windows Forms application you see in the image below

## Use the following objects:

1x ComboBox
1x ListBox
1x CheckedListBox
4x Button
The application will be tuned in this way:
an 8-element box will be created in the program, which will contain text strings of eight colors ("Black", "Red", "Blue", "Yellow", "Orange", "Green", "Brown", "White"). Use this field to populate the Combobox and CheckedListBox with these values.
Using the buttons, the user will add selected items (colors) from the ComboBox to the ListBox and delete one selected color from the ListBox with the second button.
Using the Select button, only those colors in the CheckedListBox that are added in the ListBox will be selected (CAUTION when deleting a color from the ListBox, the color must also be unchecked from the CheckedListBox)
An event will be created when the user DoubleClicks on an item in the ListBox and opens a second window, which will have the BackColor property set to the color he clicked on (+ in the header)
